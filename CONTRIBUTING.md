# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. For bug reports, documentation improvements, or pull requests, please open them in the respective runtime repository: [Python](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-python/), [Java](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-java/), and [Typescript](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript).

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use issues to suggest features, enhancements, or major proposals via RFC.

If you're suggesting a new feature (i.e., functionality that doesn't exist yet), please use our issue template.  This will prompt you to answer a few questions that will help us figure out what you're looking for. The template will also tag incoming issues with `Proposed`.  This gives us a way to filter the community-opened issues quickly so we can review as a team.

If you want to see the list of proposed features, you can see the view [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-roadmap/labels/Proposed).

Check for duplicates, though! When filing an issue, please check [existing open](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-roadmap/issues), or [recently closed](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-roadmap/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20) issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue.
